Implementation Models
=====================

RPKI is designed to allow every resource holder generate and publish cryptographic material on their own systems. This is commonly referred to as delegated RPKI. To offer a turn-key solution, each RIR also offers a hosted RPKI system in their member portals. Both models have their own advantages, based on the specific requirements of the organisation using the system. 

Hosted RPKI
-----------

To lower the entry barrier into the RPKI technology, each RIR offers a Hosted RPKI system. This allows members to log into a web-based member portal and instruct the RPKI system to generate a certificate for them, which resides on the systems hosted by the RIR.

While this offers some convenience for basic management, the LIR is not truly the holder of their own certificate. 

All certificates and ROAs are published in a distributed set of repositories. When using the Hosted RPKI system, this is a repository operated by the RIR. 

Delegated RPKI
--------------

Operators who prefer more control and have better integration with their own systems can run their own child CA. This is model is usually referred to as Delegated RPKI.

When an operator uses Delegated RPKI, they can either publish to a Publication Server that they host themselves, or they can ask a third party to do this on their behalf.
