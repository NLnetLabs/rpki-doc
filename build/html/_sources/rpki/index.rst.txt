The Resource Public Key Infrastructure
======================================

Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is technology based on open standards that is aimed at making the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) more secure. It does this by providing network operators a way to perform Route Origin Validation (ROV). 

This section explains how to use RPKI within your BGP decision making workflow to sign your own routes and filter unauthorised routes advertised by others.

The documentation is organised into the following chapters:
