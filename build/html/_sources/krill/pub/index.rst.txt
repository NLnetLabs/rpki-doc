Publication Server
==================

The publication server is functional and conforms with the IETF standards,
most notably:

- `RFC8181 — Publication Protocol <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8181>`_
- `RFC8183 — Out-of-Band Setup Protocol <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8183>`_

This project also includes a publication client utility ``pubc`` that can be
used to synchronise the contents of any directory with a publication server.
