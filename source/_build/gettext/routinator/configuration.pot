msgid "It will return the list of defaults in the same notation that is used by the optional configuration file, which will be largely similar to this:"

msgid "You can override these defaults, as well as configure a great number of additional options using either command line arguments or via the configuration file."

#: ../../routinator/configuration.rst:48
msgid "To get an overview of all available options, please refer to the :ref:`configuration file <doc_routinator_manpage_configfile>` section of the :ref:`doc_routinator_manpage`, which can be also viewed by running :command:`routinator man`."

#: ../../routinator/configuration.rst:56
msgid "Routinator can take its configuration from a file. You can specify such a config file via the :option:`-c` option. If you don’t, Routinator will check if there is a :file:`$HOME/.routinator.conf` and if it exists, use it. If it doesn’t exist and there is no :option:`-c` option, the default values are used."
msgstr ""

#: ../../routinator/configuration.rst:61
msgid "For specifying configuration options, Routinator uses a `TOML file <https://github.com/toml-lang/toml>`_. Its entries are named similarly to the command line options. A complete sample configuration file showing all the default values can be found in the repository at `etc/routinator.conf.example <https://github.com/NLnetLabs/routinator/blob/master/etc/routinator.conf.example>`_."

#: ../../routinator/configuration.rst:67
msgid "One scenario where a configuration file is required is when you would like to pass certain rsync arguments using the ``rsync-args`` setting, which is not available as a command line option. This is because Routinator will try to find out if your rsync understands the ``--contimeout`` option and set it if possible."

msgid "For example, if you want Routinator to refresh every 15 minutes and run as an RTR server on 192.0.2.13 and 2001:0DB8::13 on port 3323, in addition to providing an HTTP server on port 9556, simply take the output from :command:`routinator config` and change the ``refresh``, ``rtr-listen`` and ``http-listen`` values in your favourite text editor:"

msgid "Applying Local Exceptions"
msgstr ""

#: ../../routinator/configuration.rst:116
msgid "In some cases, you may want to override the global RPKI data set with your own local exceptions. For example, when a legitimate route announcement is inadvertently flagged as *invalid* due to a misconfigured ROA, you may want to temporarily accept it to give the operators an opportunity to resolve the issue."
msgstr ""

#: ../../routinator/configuration.rst:122
msgid "You can do this by specifying route origins that should be filtered out of the output, as well as origins that should be added, in a file using JSON notation according to the SLURM standard specified in :RFC:`8416`."

#: ../../routinator/configuration.rst:191
msgid "Use the :option:`-x` option to refer to your file with local exceptions. Routinator will re-read that file on every validation run, so you can simply update the file whenever your exceptions change."
