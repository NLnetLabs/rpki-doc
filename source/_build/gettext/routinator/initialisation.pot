msgid "Before running Routinator for the first time, you must prepare its working environment. You do this using the :subcmd:`init` command. This will prepare both the directory for the local RPKI cache, as well as the Trust Anchor Locator (TAL) directory."
msgstr ""

#: ../../routinator/initialisation.rst:11
msgid "By default, both directories will be located under ``$HOME/.rpki-cache``, but you can change their locations via the command line options :option:`--repository-dir` and :option:`--tal-dir`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../routinator/initialisation.rst:15
msgid "TALs provide hints for the trust anchor certificates to be used both to discover and validate all RPKI content. The five TALs — one for each Regional Internet Registry (RIR) — are bundled with Routinator and installed by the :subcmd:`init` command."
msgstr ""

#: ../../routinator/initialisation.rst:20
msgid "Using the TAL from ARIN, the RIR for the United States, Canada as well as many Caribbean and North Atlantic islands, requires you to read and accept their `Relying Party Agreement <https://www.arin.net/resources/manage/rpki/tal/>`_ before you can use it. Running the :subcmd:`init` command will provide you with instructions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../routinator/initialisation.rst:39
msgid "Running the :subcmd:`init` command with the :option:`--accept-arin-rpa` option will create the TAL directory and copy the five Trust Anchor Locator files into it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../routinator/initialisation.rst:47
msgid "If you decide you cannot agree to the ARIN RPA terms, the :option:`--decline-arin-rpa` option will install all TALs except the one for ARIN. If, at a later point, you wish to use the ARIN TAL anyway, you can add it to your current installation using the :option:`--force` option, to force the installation of all TALs."

#: ../../routinator/initialisation.rst:56
msgid "To see if Routinator has been initialised correctly and your firewall allows the required connections, it is recommended to perform an initial test run. You can do this by having Routinator print a validated ROA payload (VRP) list with the :subcmd:`vrps` subcommand, and using :option:`-v` to increase the log level to ``INFO`` to see if Routinator establishes rsync and RRDP connections as expected."
msgstr ""

#: ../../routinator/initialisation.rst:66
msgid "Now, you can see how Routinator connects to the RPKI trust anchors, downloads the the contents of the repositories to your machine, validates it and produces a  list of validated ROA payloads in the default CSV format to standard output. From a cold start, this process will take a couple of minutes."
