msgstr ""

#: ../../routinator/installation.rst:129
msgid "You need rsync because most RPKI repositories currently use it as its main means of distribution. Some of the cryptographic primitives used by Routinator require a C toolchain. Lastly, you need Rust because that’s the programming language that Routinator has been written in."

msgid "rsync"

#: ../../routinator/installation.rst:137
msgid "Currently, Routinator requires the :command:`rsync` executable to be in your path. Due to the nature of rsync, it is unclear which particular version you need at the very least, but whatever is being shipped with current Linux and \\*BSD distributions and macOS should be fine. Alternatively, you can download rsync from `its website <https://rsync.samba.org/>`_."

msgid "Some of the libraries Routinator depends on require a C toolchain to be present. Your system probably has some easy way to install the minimum set of packages to build from C sources. For example, :command:`apt install build-essential` will install everything you need on Debian/Ubuntu."

msgstr ""

#: ../../routinator/installation.rst:167
msgid "While some system distributions include Rust as system packages, Routinator relies on a relatively new version of Rust, currently 1.40 or newer. We therefore suggest to use the canonical Rust installation via a tool called :command:`rustup`."
