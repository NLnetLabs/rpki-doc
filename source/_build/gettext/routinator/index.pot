msgid "The application is designed to be lightweight and have great portability. This means it can run on any Unix-like operating system, but also works on Microsoft Windows. Due to its lean design, it can run effortlessly on minimalist hardware such as a Raspberry Pi. Monitoring is possible through the built-in Prometheus endpoint. It allows you to build :ref:`beautiful dashboards <doc_routinator_monitoring_grafana>` for detailed insights."

msgid "Routinator connects to the Trust Anchors of the five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) — APNIC, AFRINIC, ARIN, LACNIC and RIPE NCC — downloads all of the certificates and ROAs in the various repositories, verifies the signatures and makes the result available for use in the BGP workflow. It can perform RPKI validation as a one-time operation and store the result on disk in formats such as CSV, JSON and RPSL, or run as a service that periodically fetches and verifies RPKI data. The data is then served via the built-in HTTP server, or fetched from RPKI-capable routers via the RPKI-RTR protocol."
