msgid "A separate daemon that implements RPKI to the Router protocol (RTR), allowing *validated prefix origin* data to be delivered to routers. The RPKI-RTR Server is set up as a separate deamon because not everyone needs to run it. Far more importantly, a separate daemon allows you to start multiple instances for redundancy."

msgid "You will need a UNIX-like system with OpenJDK 8 or higher and rsync. You will also need at least 1.5GB of RAM available on your server (2GB in total if you also run the RPKI-RTR server). One (virtual) CPU should be enough. The repository objects are stored in a file-based database, rather than in memory, for which we recommend at least 10GB of available disk space."
