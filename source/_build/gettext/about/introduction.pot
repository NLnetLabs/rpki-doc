msgid "Welcome to the documentation of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). Here, we aim to offer an overview of the RPKI technology itself, as well as some of the tools that are being developed for it. Any software implementer is welcome to add documentation for their tools to this project."

msgid "This page gives a broad overview of the RPKI and how it can help make Internet routing using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) more secure. This way, you will learn how RPKI can benefit your organisation, as well as helping others to be more secure on the Internet."

#: ../../about/introduction.rst:21
msgid "This documentation is continuously written, corrected and edited by the RPKI team at NLnet Labs. An initial version was written by Alex Band, Tim Bruijnzeels and Martin Hoffmann. Over time, additions from the network operator community, researchers and interested parties around the world were contributed. The documentation is edited via text files in the `reStructuredText <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html>`_ markup language and then compiled into a static website/offline document using the open source `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_  and `ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ tools."

msgstr ""

#: ../../about/introduction.rst:42
msgid "RPKI allows holders of Internet number resources to make verifiable statements about how they intend to use their resources. To achieve this, it uses a public key infrastructure that creates a chain of resource certificates that follows the same structure as the way IP addresses and AS numbers are handed down."
msgstr ""

#: ../../about/introduction.rst:47
msgid "RPKI is used to make Internet routing more secure. It is a community-driven system in which open source software developers, router vendors and all five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) participate, i.e. `ARIN <https://www.arin.net/resources/rpki/>`_, `APNIC <https://www.apnic.net/community/security/resource-certification/>`_, `AFRINIC <https://www.afrinic.net/resource-certification>`_, `LACNIC <https://www.lacnic.net/640/2/lacnic/general-information-resource-certification-system-rpki>`_ and `RIPE NCC <https://www.ripe.net/manage-ips-and-asns/resource-management/certification/>`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../about/introduction.rst:57
msgid "Currently, RPKI is used to let the legitimate holder of a block of IP addresses make an authoritative statement about which AS is authorised to originate their prefix in the BGP. In turn, other network operators can download and validate these statements and make routing decisions based on them. This process is referred to as route origin validation (ROV). This provides a stepping stone to provide path validation in the future."
