msgid "RPKI is designed to allow every resource holder to generate and publish cryptographic material on their own systems. This is commonly referred to as delegated RPKI. To offer a turn-key solution, each RIR also offers a hosted RPKI system in their member portals. Both models have their own advantages, based on the specific requirements of the organisation using the system."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rpki/implementation-models.rst:13
msgid "No matter what implementation model you choose, it always a good idea to publish ROAs for your BGP announcements. Even when you are still evaluating how to deploy RPKI within your organisation, the benefits are immediate. Others can already filter based on what you publish, offering protection for you and other Internet users. For example, in case someone inadvertently announces your address space from their AS, it will be flagged as Invalid and dropped by everyone who has deployed route origin validation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rpki/implementation-models.rst:21
msgid "Once you start authorising announcements with RPKI, it is imperative that ROAs are created for all route origins from the prefixes you hold, including more specifics announced by other business units or customers. In addition, RPKI should become a standard part of operations, ensuring staff is trained and ROAs are continually monitored and maintained."

msgstr ""

#: ../../rpki/implementation-models.rst:33
msgid "In 2008, when the five RIRs committed to start offering RPKI services, it was clear that there would be an early adopters phase for a considerable amount of time. Given the past experiences with IPv6 and DNSSEC uptake, the RIRs decided to offer a hosted RPKI solution to lower the entry barrier into the technology. This way, organisations could easily get operational experience with the technology, without having to manage a certificate authority themselves."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rpki/implementation-models.rst:40
msgid "Hosted RPKI offers a fair balance between ease-of-use, maintenance and flexibility. It allows users to log into their RIR member portal and request a resource certificate, which is securely hosted on the servers of the RIR. All cryptographic operations, such as key roll overs, are automated. The certificates and ROA are published in repositories hosted by the RIR. In short, there is nothing that the user has to manage, apart from creating and maintaining ROAs."

msgid "The functionality and user interfaces of the hosted RPKI implementations vary greatly across the five RIRs. Despite these variations, if you are an organisation with a single ASN and a handful of statically announced IP address blocks that are not delegated to customers, hosted RPKI is sufficient for most use cases."

msgstr ""

#: ../../rpki/implementation-models.rst:67
msgid "First, the table indicates if the RPKI system supports setting up delegated RPKI, so users can run their own certificate authority if they want. An RIR may also offer a publication server for users running delegated RPKI.  When using the hosted RPKI system, there is an overview if multiple users can be authorised to manage ROAs, and whether they can authenticate using two-factors."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rpki/implementation-models.rst:73
msgid "To make management of ROAs easier, some systems provide a list of all announcements with certified address space that are seen by BGP route collectors, such as the `RIPE Routing Information Service (RIS) <https://www.ripe.net/analyse/internet-measurements/routing-information-service-ris>`_. ROAs have an explicit start and end validity date, but in some cases it is possible to automatically renew the ROAs, so that they are valid for as long as there is an entry in the web interface. In addition, it may be possible to synchronise the management of *\"route\"* objects in the IRR with the ROAs that are created. An application programming interface (API) may be provided to make batch processing easier."
