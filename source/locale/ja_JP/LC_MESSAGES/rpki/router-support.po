"Several router vendors participated in the development of the RPKI "
"standards in the IETF, ensuring the technology offered an end-to-end "
"solution for route origin validation. The RPKI to Router protocol (RPKI-"
"RTR) is standardised in :RFC:`6810` (v0) and :RFC:`8210` (v1). Is it "
"specifically designed to deliver validated prefix origin data to routers."
" This, as well as origin validation functionality, is currently available"
" in on various hardware platforms and software solutions."
