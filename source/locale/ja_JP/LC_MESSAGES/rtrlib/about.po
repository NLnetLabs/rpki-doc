"RTRlib is a C library that implements the client side of the RPKI-RTR "
"protocol as well as route origin validation. Basically, it maintains data"
" from an RPKI cache server (e.g., Routinator) and allows to verify "
"whether an autonomous system (AS) is the legitimate origin AS, based on "
"the fetched valid ROA data. It is prepared for BGPsec path validation."

"RTRlib powers RPKI in BGP software routers such as `FRR "
"<https://frrouting.org/>`_ and is the base for monitoring tools. A Python"
" binding is available. The basis RTRlib package includes the library and "
"lightweight command line tools."

"RTRlib gives easy and highly efficient access to cryptographically valid "
"RPKI data without relying on a specific cache server or RPKI validator "
"implementation. To prevent single point of failures, it handles failover "
"between multiple cache servers."

"Not only developers of routing software but also network operators "
"benefit from RTRlib. Developers can integrate the RTRlib into their BGP "
"daemon to extend their implementation towards RPKI. Network operators may"
" use the RTRlib to develop monitoring tools (e.g., to evaluate the "
"performance of caches or to validate BGP data)."
