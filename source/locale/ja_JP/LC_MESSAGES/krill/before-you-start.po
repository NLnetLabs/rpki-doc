"RPKI is a very modular system and so is Krill. Which parts you need and "
"how you fit them together depends on your situation. Before you begin "
"with installing Krill, there are some basic concepts you should "
"understand and some decisions you need to make."

"With Krill there are two fundamental pieces at play. The first part is "
"the Certificate Authority (CA), which takes care of all the cryptographic"
" operations involved in RPKI. Secondly, there is the publication server "
"which makes your certificate and ROAs available to the world."
msgstr ""

#: ../../krill/before-you-start.rst:19
msgid ""
"In almost all cases you will need to run the CA that Krill provides under"
" a parent CA, usually your Regional Internet Registry (RIR) or National "
"Internet Registry (NIR). The communication between the parent and the "
"child CA is initiated through the exchange of two XML files, which you "
"need to handle manually: a child request XML and a parent response XML. "
"This involves generating the request file, providing it to your parent, "
"and giving the response file back to your CA."
msgstr ""

#: ../../krill/before-you-start.rst:27
msgid ""
"After this initial exchange has been completed, all subsequent requests "
"and responses are handled by the parent and child CA themselves. This "
"includes the entitlement request and response that determines which "
"resources you receive on your certificate, the certificate request and "
"response, as well as the revoke request and response."
msgstr ""

#: ../../krill/before-you-start.rst:33
msgid ""
"The initial XML file exchange is the only manual step required to get "
"started with Delegated RPKI. All other requests and responses, as well as"
" re-signing and renewing certificates and ROAs are automated. **As long "
"as Krill is running, it will automatically update the entitled resources "
"on your certificate, as well as reissue certificates, ROAs and all other "
"objects before they expire or become stale.** Note that even if Krill "
"does go down, you have 8 hours to bring it back up before data starts "
"going stale."

msgid ""
"Whether you also run the Krill publication server depends on if you can, "
"or want to use one offered by a third party. For the general wellbeing of"
" the RPKI ecosystem, we would generally recommend to publish with your "
"parent CA, if available. Setting this up is done in the same way as with "
"the CA: exchanging a publisher request XML and a repository response XML."

"If you can use a publication server provided by your parent, the "
"installation and configuration of Krill becomes extremely easy. After the"
" installation has completed, you perform the XML exchange twice and you "
"are done."

msgid ""
"Krill is designed to run continuously, but there is no strict uptime "
"requirement for the CA. If the CA is not available you just cannot create"
" or update ROAs. This means you can bring Krill down to perform "
"maintenance or migration, as long as you bring it back up within 8 hours "
"to ensure your cryptographic objects are re-signed before they go stale."

"This scenario illustrated here also applies if you use an RPKI "
"publication server offered by a third party, such as a cloud provider."

"At this time, only Brazilian NIR NIC.br offer a publication server for "
"their members. Several RIRs have this functionality on their roadmap. "
"This means that in most cases, you will have to publish yourself."

"Krill features a publication server, disabled by default, but which can "
"be used to host a server for yourself, and others, such as customers or "
"business units who run their own Krill CAs as children under your CA, and"
" to whom you have delegated resource certificates."

"If you run Krill as a publication server, you will be faced with running "
"a public service with all related responsibilities, such as uptime and "
"DDoS protection. So, this option is not recommended if you don't have a "
"clear need to run your own server."

"The system requirements for Krill are quite minimal. The cryptographic "

"When you publish ROAs yourself using the Krill publication server in "
"combination with Rsyncd and a web server of your choice, you will see "
"traffic from several hundred relying party software tools querying every "
"few minutes. The total amount of traffic is also negligible for any "
"modern day situation."

"For reference, NLnet Labs runs Krill in production and serves ROAs to the"
