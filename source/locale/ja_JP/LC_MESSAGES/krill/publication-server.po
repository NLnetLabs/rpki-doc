"It is highly recommended to use an RPKI publication server provided by "
"your parent CA, if available. This relieves you of the responsibility to "
"keep a public rsync and web server available at all times."

"If you need to run your own Publication Server using Krill, then we "
"recommend that you use a separate Krill instance acting as a repository "
"only. This setup allows for much easier reconfiguration (more on this "
"below), and it allows that other CAs - for example a delegated CA for one"
" of your business units also publish at this same Publication Server."

"The Krill UI is not currently aimed at using Krill as a repository "
"server. For example when visiting the UI of a Krill instance intended for"
" use only as a repository and not as a CA, it will still prompt you on "
"first use to create a CA. There is also no support via the UI for "
"managing the repository, for example it is not possible via the UI to "
"complete a child request to register with the repository."

"Krill can be set up to run as a Publication Server through its "
"configuration file. If enabled, the Publication Server is created on "
"start-up. After this any updates to the configuration will *NOT* be "
"reflected in the Publication Server."
msgstr ""

#: ../../krill/publication-server.rst:42
msgid ""
"For this reason you should double check the values used for the public "
"URIs to your repository server carefully before the set-up. Using a "
"dedicated Krill instance for the Publication Server will allow you to "
"simply destroy and replace the instance should it have been "
"misconfigured."

"The easiest way to make a configuration file is by using :ref:`krillc "
"config<cmd_krillc_config>`  to generate the required configuration for "
"you. For example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../krill/publication-server.rst:60
msgid ""
"Make sure that the ``--server`` option reflects a base URI that your "
"Krill CA publication clients can reach, and make sure that this URI is "
"exposed using a proxy server that has a proper HTTPS certificate "
"configured."
msgstr ""

#: ../../krill/publication-server.rst:64
msgid ""
"Make sure that the ``--rrdp`` and ``--rsync`` options match the "
"configuration of your \"Repository Servers\" which make your repository "
"available over HTTPS and rsync to Relying Parties."
msgstr ""

#: ../../krill/publication-server.rst:68
msgid ""
"It would have been better to make the Publication Server configuration "
"something that should be done run-time, as this would match more "
"intuitively with the fact that the `server`, `rrdp` and `rsync` URIs "
"cannot be changed through the configuration file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../krill/publication-server.rst:73
msgid ""
"In a future release of Krill we may do exactly that. But, even if we do "
"it would be ill advised to allow changing these URIs at run time, as "
"there would be no way for the Krill Publication Server to inform its "
"publishers about any change."
msgstr ""

"So, in short, this needs to be set up correctly once. If it turns out to "

msgstr ""

#: ../../krill/publication-server.rst:92
msgid ""
"Note that you should not add any additional authentication mechanisms to "
"this location. RFC 8181 uses cryptographically signed messages sent over "
"HTTP and is secure. However, verifying messages and signing responses can"
