"The global routing system of the Internet consists of a number of "

"(Border Gateway Protocol) to exchange routing information. The system is "
"very dynamic and flexible by design. Connectivity and routing topologies "
"are subject to change. Changes easily propagate globally within a few "

"Het systeem is ontworpen om flexibel en dynamisch te werken. Connectiviteit "

"If you've been involved in default-free zone Internet engineering for any"
" length of time, you're probably familiar with RPSL, a routing policy "
"specification language originally defined in :RFC:`2280` back in 1998. "
"While RPSL has created considerable early enthusiasm and has seen some "
"traction, the Internet was rapidly growing at the time, and the primary "
"focus was on data availability rather than data trustworthiness. Everyone"
" was busy opportunistically documenting the minimal policy that was "
"necessary to \"make things work\" with the policy specification language "
"parsing scripts of everyone else so that something would finally ping!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../about/faq.rst:51
msgid ""
"Over time, this has created an extensive repository of obsolete data of "
"uncertain validity spread across dozens of route registries around the "

"to be too complex to consistently transpose policy into router "
"configuration language - resulting in most published RPSL data being "

"sufficiently comprehensive or precise for being the golden master in "
"router configuration."

"RPKI aims to complement and expand upon this effort focusing primarily on"
" trustworthiness, timeliness, and accuracy of data. RPKI ROAs are "

"The main weakness of the IRR is that it is not a globally deployed system"
" and it lacks the authorisation model to make the system water tight. The"
" result is that out of all the information on routing intent that is "
"published, it is difficult to determine what is legitimate, authentic "

msgstr ""

#: ../../about/faq.rst:96
msgid ""
"While Path Validation is a desirable characteristic, the existing RPKI "

msgstr ""

#: ../../about/faq.rst:99
msgid ""
"Existing operational and economic incentives ensure that the most "
"important prefixes for each network are seen via the shortest AS path "
"possible. One such example are network operators setting a higher local "
"preference for prefixes learned via an Internet exchange or private peers"
" (\"peerlock\"). This reduces the risk that an invalid route could win "
"the BGP route selection process even if it originates from an "
"impersonated but correct origin AS."
msgstr ""

#: ../../about/faq.rst:106
msgid ""
"For transit providers, direct interconnections and short AS paths are a "
"defining characteristic, positioning them ideally to act on RPKI data and"
" accept only valid routes for redistribution."
msgstr ""

#: ../../about/faq.rst:110
msgid ""
"Furthermore, operational experience suggests that the vast majority of "
"route hijacks are unintentional rather than malicious, and are caused by "
"‘fat-fingering’, where an operator accidentally originates a prefix they "
"are not the holder of. Origin Validation would mitigate many of these "
"problems."
msgstr ""

#: ../../about/faq.rst:115
msgid ""
"While a malicious party willing to intentionally impersonate the origin "
"AS could still take advantage of the lack of Path Validation in some "
"circumstances, widespread RPKI Origin Validation implementation would "

"No, routers do not do any cryptographic operations to perform Route "

msgid ""
"When RPKI relying party software is used on a client system, it has a "

#: ../../about/faq.rst:189
msgid ""
"To overcome these limitations the RRDP protocol was developed and "
