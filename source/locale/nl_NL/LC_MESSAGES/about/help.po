"If you're reading this page, chances are you find yourself in a situation"
" where you've been told by someone that your RPKI ROAs make your routes "
"invalid and you don't know what that means.  The aim of the content on "

"resources that can be of assistance. This page is not meant for experts, "
"and many technicalities will be glossed over in order to be able to "

"The \"root\" assigner of all IP space (v4+v6) is IANA.  They have "
"delegated this space to one of the RIRs (ARIN, RIPE NCC, APNIC, LACNIC, "
"and AFRINIC).  In turn, those RIRs assign the space to other entities. "
"Each RIR has a portal where the owner of the space can assert the "
"origination ASN, which then generates a ROA for that particular "
"combination of route and origination ASN.  This ROA is then published out"
" by the RIR so that anyone can view them."

"It is important to note that initially, for there to be an RPKI Invalid "
"route, someone must have already entered into one of the above portals "
