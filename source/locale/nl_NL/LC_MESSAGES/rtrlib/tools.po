"The RTRlib software package includes two lightweight command line tools "
"to showcase some of the RTRlib features.  ``rtr-client`` connects to an "
"RPKI cache server, fetches and maintains the valid ROA payloads, and "
"prints the received data. ``rpki-rov`` allows to verify whether an "
"autonomous system is the legitimate origin AS of an IP prefix, based on "
"RPKI data."

"If you want to use these command line tools, you need an RPKI-RTR "
"connection to an RPKI cache server (e.g., Routinator). For those who do "
"not have access to a cache server, we provide a public cache with "
"*hostname* ``rpki-validator.realmv6.org`` and *port* ``8282``."

"To establish a connection to RPKI cache servers, the client can use *TCP*"
" or *SSH* transport sockets.  To run the program you have to specify the "
"transport protocol as well as the hostname and port of the RPKI cache "
"server; additionally you can set several options.  To get a complete "
"reference over all options for the command simply run ``rtrclient`` in a "
"shell."

"legitimate origin AS numbers.  Each line represents either a ROA that was"
" added (``+``) or removed (``-``) from the selected RPKI cache server.  "
"The RTRlib client will receive and print such updates until the program "
