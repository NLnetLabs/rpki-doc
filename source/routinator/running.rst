Running
=======

Routinator can perform RPKI validation as a one-time operation and print a Validated ROA Payload (VRP) list in various formats, or it can run as a service that periodically
fetches RPKI data, verifies it and makes the result available via the RPKI-RTR protocol,
and via the built-in HTTP server.

When launched as a daemon, routers with support for route origin validation (ROV) 
can connect to Routinator to fetch the processed data. This includes hardware 
routers such as `Juniper
<https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/topic-map/bgp-origin
-as-validation.html>`_, `Cisco
<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/iproute_bgp/configuration/
15-s/irg-15-s-book/irg-origin-as.html>`_ and `Nokia
<https://infocenter.alcatel-lucent.com/public/7750SR160R4A/index.jsp?topic=%
2Fcom.sr.unicast%2Fhtml%2Fbgp.html&cp=22_4_7_2&anchor=d2e5366>`_, as well as
software solutions like `BIRD <https://bird.network.cz/>`_, `GoBGP <https://osrg.github.io/gobgp/>`_ and :ref:`others <doc_rpki_rtr>`. The processed 
data is also available in a number of useful output formats, such as 
CSV, JSON, RPSL and a format specifically for `OpenBGPD <http://openbgpd.org>`_.

These and all other functions of Routinator are accessible on the command
line via sub-commands:

:vrps:
     Fetches RPKI data and produces a Validated ROA Payload (VRP) list in the 
     specified format.
     
:server:
     Starts the daemon that periodically fetches and verifies RPKI data, after
     which it exposes the VRPs via RPKI-RTR, HTTP, or both.
     
First Launch
------------

.. WARNING:: Routinator comes pre-installed with the Trust Anchor Locators (TALs) 
             of four out of the five RIRs. The ARIN TAL is not automatically loaded, 
             as users must first confirm their acceptance of the `ARIN Relying Party
             Agreement (RPA) <https://www.arin.net/resources/rpki/tal.html>`_. 

To see if Routinator is configured correctly, it is recommended to have it print
a Validated ROA Payload (VRP) list and use ``-v`` to increase the log level:

.. code-block:: bash

   routinator -v vrps

When you run Routinator for the very first time, it will create
``$HOME/.rpki-cache``, put the Trust Anchor Locators (TALs) of the five RIRs
there, and then complain that ARINâ€™s TAL is in fact not really there:

.. code-block:: text

   $ routinator -v vrps
   MISSING TRUST ANCHOR LOCATOR
   
   The trust anchor locator (TAL) in file
   
      /home/me/.rpki-cache/tals/arin.tal
      
   has not been installed. Please go to
   
      https://www.arin.net/resources/rpki/tal.html
      
   and download the TAL in RFC 7730 format. Place the downloaded file at
   
      /home/me/.rpki-cache/tals/arin.tal
      
   Routinator will refuse to run until you have done that.

Follow the instructions provided and try again. 

Now, Routinator will rsync the entire RPKI repository to your machine, validate it and produce a list of AS numbers and prefixes in the default CSV format. From a cold start,
this process will take about two minutes.

Printing a List of VRPs
-----------------------

Routinator can produce Validated ROA Payload (VRP) list in five different formats,
which are either printed to standard output or saved to a file:

:csv: 
      The list is formatted as lines of comma-separated values of the prefix in
      slash notation, the maximum prefix length, the autonomous system number, 
      and an abbreviation for the trust anchor the entry is derived from. The 
      latter is the name of the TAL file  without the extension *.tal*. This is 
      the default format used if the ``-f`` option is missing.
:csvext: 
      This is an extended version of the *csv* format, which was used by the RIPE
      NCC RPKI Validator 1.x. Each line contains these comma-separated values: the
      rsync URI of the ROA the line is taken from (or "N/A" if it isn't from a ROA),
      the autonomous system number, the prefix in slash notation, the maximum prefix
      length, the not-before date and not-after date of the validity of the ROA.
:json:
      The list is placed into a JSON object with a single  element *roas* which
      contains an array of objects with four elements each: The autonomous system 
      number of  the  network  authorised to originate a prefix in *asn*, the prefix
      in slash notation in *prefix*, the maximum prefix length of the announced route
      in *maxLength*, and the trust anchor from which the authorisation was derived 
      in *ta*. This format is identical to that produced by the RIPE NCC Validator 
      except for different naming of the trust anchor. Routinator uses the name 
      of the TAL file without the extension *.tal* whereas the RIPE NCC Validator 
      has a dedicated name for each.
:openbgpd:
      Choosing  this format causes Routinator to produce a *roa-set*
      configuration item for the OpenBGPD configuration.
:rpsl:
      This format produces a list of RPSL objects with the authorisation in the
      fields *route*, *origin*, and *source*. In addition, the fields *descr*,
      *mnt-by*, *created*, and *last-modified*, are present with more or less
      meaningful values.

For example, to get a file with with the validated ROA payload in JSON format, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   routinator vrps --format json --output authorisedroutes.json

Running the HTTP Service
------------------------

The CSV, JSON, OpenBGPD and RPSL formats that Routinator can produce are available
via HTTP if the application is running as a service. The HTTP server is not enabled
by default for security reasons, nor does it have a default host or port. In order
to start the HTTP server at 192.0.2.13 and 2001:0DB8::13 on port 8323, run this
command:

.. code-block:: bash

   routinator server --http 192.0.2.13:8323 --http [2001:0DB8::13]:8323

The application will stay attached to your terminal unless you provide the ``-d`` (for daemon) option. After fetching and validating the data set, the following paths are available:

:/csv:
     Returns the current set of VRPs in csv output format

:/json:
     Returns the current set of VRPs in json output format

:/openbgpd:
     Returns the current set of VRPs in openbgpd output format

:/rpsl:
     Returns the current set of VRPs in rpsl output format

Please note that this server is intended to run on your internal network and doesn't
offer HTTPS natively. If this is a requirement, you can for example run Routinator behind an `nginx <https://www.nginx.com>`_ reverse proxy. 

Also, the HTTP server also provides paths that allow you to monitor Routinator, so it 
may be desirable to have the HTTP server running alongside the RTR server. For more information, please refer to the :ref:`doc_routinator_monitoring` section.

Running the RTR Service
-----------------------

Routinator supports RPKI-RTR as specified in `RFC 8210
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8210>`_ as well as the older version from `RFC 6810 
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7730>`_. Like the HTTP server, the RTR server is not
started by default, nor does it have a default host or port. Thus, in order to start
the RTR server at 192.0.2.13 and 2001:0DB8::13 on port 3323, run this command:

.. code-block:: bash

   routinator server --rtr 192.0.2.13:3323 --rtr [2001:0DB8::13]:3323

Please note that port 3323 is not the IANA-assigned default port for the protocol, 
which would be 323. But as this is a privileged port, you would need to be running
Routinator as root when otherwise there is no reason to do that. The application will
stay attached to your terminal unless you provide the ``-d`` (for daemon) option.

By default, the repository will be updated and re-validated every hour as per the
recommendation in the RFC. You can change this via the ``--refresh`` option and specify
the interval between re-validations in seconds. That is, if you rather have Routinator
validate every 15 minutes, the above command becomes:

.. code-block:: bash

   routinator server --rtr 192.0.2.13:3323 --rtr [2001:0DB8::13]:3323 --refresh=900
    
Communication between Routinator and the router using the RPKI-RTR protocol is done
via plain TCP. In the next section, there is an explanation how to secure the transport
using either SSH or TLS.
