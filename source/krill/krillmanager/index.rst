Krill Manager
=============

Krill Manager is a tool for running Krill as a highly available scalable service with integration points for monitoring and log analysis.

.. Tip:: Krill Manager is available as a `DigitalOcean Marketplace 1-Click App <https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/krill>`_.
         In future we hope to also publish instructions for using
         Krill Manager in other hosting environments. For the adventurous you
         should be able to run Krill Manager on any Linux host that has Bash,
         Docker and Gluster installed.
