CA Name
=======

Normally with a new instance of Krill, on first visit to Krill's web user
interface you will be prompted to enter the name of your Certificate Authority.

Krill Manager streamlines this process by asing you for the Certificate
Authority name during the Krill Manager wizard. Once the wizard is complete Krill
Manager will automatically create a CA in Krill by the name that you give here:

You can name the CA anything you like. If you use characters that are not
permitted the wizard will ask you to edit the name until it meets the naming
requirements.
