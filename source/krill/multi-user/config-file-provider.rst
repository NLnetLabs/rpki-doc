Config File Users
=================

.. versionadded:: v0.9.0

Introduction
------------

By setting ``auth_type = "config-file"`` in ``krill.conf`` you can configure Krill
to require users to enter a username and password in the web user interface when
logging in, rather than the secret token that is usually required:

.. figure:: img/config-file-login.png
    :align: center
    :width: 100%
    :alt: Config file login screen

    Enter config file user credentials to access Krill

.. Note:: It is important to realize that Krill is not a complete user management
          system and that Config File Users therefore have some :ref:`limitations <limitations>`.

          While Config File Users are useful as a quick way to test named user
          support in Krill and may suffice for simple situations, in larger more
          critical settings you are strongly advised to consider using
          :ref:`doc_krill_multi_user_openid_connect_provider` instead.

How does it work?
-----------------

To add a user to the ``krill.conf`` file an administrator uses the ``krillc``
command to compute a password *hash* for the user and then adds an entry to the
``[auth_users]`` section including their username, password *hash* and any :ref:`attributes <doc_krill_multi_user_access_control>`
that are relevant for that user.

When a user enters their username and password into the web user interface a 
hash of the password is computed and sent with the username to the Krill server.

The Krill server will verify that the user logging in provided a correct
password and has the ``LOGIN`` permission. On success Krill will respond with a
token which the web user interface should send on subsequent requests to
authenticate itself with Krill. The web user interface will keep a copy of this
token in browser local storage until the user logs out or is timed out due to
inactivity.

.. tip:: The actual user password is **NEVER** stored on either the Krill server
         nor the client browser and is **NEVER** sent by the client browser to
         the Krill server. Only password *hashes* are stored and transmitted.

.. warning:: Do **NOT** serve the Krill web user interface over unencrypted HTTP.
             While the password is never transmitted, the authentication token
             that the user is subsequently issued is subject to interception
             by malicious parties if sent unencrypted from the Krill server to
             the web user interface. Note that this is equally true when using
             any credential to authenticate with Krill, whether secret token
             or password hash or when Krill is configured to interact with an
             OpenID Connect provider.

.. _limitations:

Known limitations
-----------------

Config File Users are easy to define and give you complete control over who
has access to your Krill instance and what level of access is granted. However,
Krill is not a complete user management system and so there are some things to
remember when using Config File Users:

- Krill has no feature for requiring a user to change their password on first
  login. As such, by issuing users with passwords you become responsible for
  delivering the new password to them securely.

- Krill has no feature for generating cryptographically strong passwords. You
  are responsible for choosing sufficiently strong passwords for your users.

- Usernames, password hashes and user attributes are sensitive information. By
  adding them to your ``krill.conf`` file you become responsible for protecting
  them.

- If you lose you ``krill.conf`` file you will also lose the password hashes
  and will have to reset your users passwords unless you have a (**secure**)
  copy elsewhere.

- If a user forgets their password you will need to issue them with a new one.
  Krill does not offer a forgotten password or password reset feature.

- Adding or changing users requires a restart of Krill. There is no support in
  Krill at present for reloading the user details while Krill is running.
  While Krill is restarting the web user interface will be unavailable for your
  users.

Setting it up
-------------

The following steps are required to use local users in your Krill setup.

1. Decide on the settings to be configured.
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Decide which usernames you are going to configure, and what :ref:`role <doc_krill_multi_user_access_control>`
and password they should have. For this example let's assume we want to
configure the following users:

================= ======== =========
Username          Password Role
================= ======== =========
joe@example.com   dFdsapE5 admin
sally             wdGypnx5 readonly
dave_the_octopus  qnky8Zuj readwrite
================= ======== =========

----

2. Configure Krill
""""""""""""""""""

For each user generate a password hash using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ krillc config user --id joe@example.com
  Enter the password to hash: dFdsapE5
   
  [auth_users]
  "joe@example.com" = { password_hash="f45d...b25f" }

Then add the ``auth_type``, ``[auth_users]`` and individual user lines
to ``krill.conf``. The end result should look something like this:

.. code-block:: bash

   auth_type = "config-file"

   [auth_users]
   "joe@example.com"  = { attributes={ role="admin" },     password_hash="f45d...b25f" }
   "sally"            = { attributes={ role="readonly" },  password_hash="..." }
   "dave_the_octopus" = { attributes={ role="readwrite" }, password_hash="..." }

----

3. Go!
""""""

Restart Krill and deliver the chosen passwords to the respective users to
whom they belong. The users should now be able to login to your Krill instance.

.. Warning:: Take whatever steps you think are necessary to ensure that the
             passwords are delivered **securely** to your users.

Advanced configuration
----------------------

The information above gives you the basic structure for the configuration
file syntax needed to configure local users in Krill.

See :ref:`doc_krill_multi_user_access_control` for information about
other user attributes and configuration settings that you might want to
use.

See :ref:`doc_krill_multi_user_custom_policies` for information about
customizing the configuration even further.

Below is a slightly modified version of the example above that also
uses the ``inc_cas``, ``exc_cas`` and ``auth_private_attributes`` features
and adds a user that has custom team attributes as well. Notice how the 
team user does **NOT** have a ``role`` attribute!

.. code-block:: bash

   auth_type = "config-file"
   auth_private_attributes = [ "exc_cas" ]

   [auth_users]
   "joe@example.com"   = { attributes={ role="admin" }, password_hash="f45d...b25f" }
   "sally"             = { attributes={ role="readonly", inc_cas="ca1,ca3" },  password_hash="..." }
   "dave_the_octopus"  = { attributes={ role="readwrite" }, exc_cas="some_private_ca" }, password_hash="..." }
   "rob_from_team_one" = { attributes={ team="t1", teamrole="readwrite" }, password_hash="..." }

Additional sources of information
---------------------------------

The ``krill.conf`` file is the definitive guide to the possible values that
can be used in the Krill configuration file. If in doubt, consult the 
``krill.conf`` file that came with your copy of Krill.

Login related events will be reported in the Krill logs:

- Login failures are reported at error level.
- Login successes are reported at info level.
- Additional diagnostics may be reported at debug or trace level.
