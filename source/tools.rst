Software Projects
=================

This section provides an overview of all well known open source projects that
support RPKI. It includes Relying Party software for validating RPKI data,
Certificate  Authority software to run RPKI on your own infrastructure and
supporting tools that help deployment and integration.

Relying Party Software
----------------------

`Dragon Research Labs Validating Cache <https://github.com/dragonresearch/rpki.net>`_
   Software to fetch and validate RPKI certificates and serve them to routers by Dragon
   Research Labs, written in the Python programming language.

`Fort Validator <https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator>`_
   MIT-licensed Relying Party software by NIC.mx, written in C.

`OctoRPKI <https://github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki#octorpki>`_
   Cloudflare's Relying Party software, written in the Go programming language.

`RIPE NCC RPKI Validator <https://www.ripe.net/manage-ips-and-asns/resource-management/certification/tools-and-resources>`_
   Full-featured RPKI relying party software, written by the RIPE NCC
   in the Java programming language.

`Routinator <https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/rpki/routinator/>`_
   RPKI relying party software written by NLnet Labs in the Rust programming language,
   designed to have a small footprint and great portability.

`rpki-client(8) <https://github.com/kristapsdz/rpki-client>`_
   rpki-client is written in C as part of the rpki-client(1) project, an RPKI validator
   for OpenBSD.

`RPSTIR <https://github.com/bgpsecurity/rpstir/>`_
   Relying Party Security Technology for Internet Routing (RPSTIR) software,
   initially written by Raytheon BBN Technologies in the C programming language,
   now maintained by ZDNS.

Certificate Authority Software
------------------------------

`Dragon Research Labs Certificate Authority <https://github.com/dragonresearch/rpki.net>`_
   RPKI Certificate Authority software by Dragon Research Labs, written in
   the Python programming language.

`Krill <https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/rpki/krill/>`_
   RPKI Certificate Authority software by NLnet Labs, written in the Rust
   programming language.

Supporting Tools
----------------

`BGP-SRx <https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/bgp-secure-routing-extension-bgp-srx-prototype>`_
   SRx is an open source reference implementation and research platform by the
   National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST). It is intended for
   investigating emerging BGP security extensions and supporting protocols such
   as RPKI Origin Validation and BGPSec Path Validation.

`GoRTR <https://github.com/cloudflare/gortr>`_
   An open-source implementation of RPKI to Router protocol (RFC 6810)
   using the Go programming language. This project is maintained by Louis
   Poinsignon at Cloudflare.

`pmacct <http://pmacct.net>`_
   pmacct is a small set of multi-purpose passive network monitoring tools.
   It can account, classify, aggregate, replicate and export forwarding-plane
   data, i.e. IPv4 and IPv6 traffic; collect and correlate control-plane data
   via BGP and BMP; collect and correlate RPKI data; collect infrastructure
   data via Streaming Telemetry.

   The pmacct toolset can perform RPKI Origin Validation and present
   the outcome as a property in the flow aggregation process. Because it
   separates out the various types kinds of (invalid) BGP announcements,
   operators can a good grasp on how their connectivity to the rest of the
   Internet would look like after deploying a *"invalid == reject"* policy.

`rpki-ov-checker <https://github.com/job/rpki-ov-checker>`_
   rpki-ov-checker is an open source utility to quickly analyse BGP RIB dumps
   and the potential impact of deploying "invalid is reject" routing policies.

:ref:`rtrlib`
   The RTRlib implements the client-side of the RPKI-RTR protocol (RFC
   6810, RFC 8210) and BGP Prefix Origin Validation (RFC 6811). This also
   enables the maintenance of router keys, which are required to
   deploy BGPSec.

   RTRlib was originally founded by researchers from the Computer Systems & Telematics
   group at Freie Universität Berlin and reseachers from the INET research group at
   Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, under the supervision of Matthias Wählisch
   and Thomas Schmidt. It is now a community project.
